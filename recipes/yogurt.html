<p>I'll share my recipe and walk you through all the steps so you can make homemade yogurt on your stove top, in your slow cooker, or in your Instant Pot.</p>
<h3><em>Ingredients</em>:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Culture</li>
    <li>Large sacupean</li>
    <li>Spatula</li>
    <li>Cheesecloth</li>
    <li>Clean glass jar with lids</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li><h2>Choose your milk</h2>
    <p>Start with a half-gallon of pasteurized milk (avoid ultra-pasteurized or UHT milk). Whole milk will make the thickest and creamiest yogurt, while skim milk will produce a lighter and looser texture.</p></li>
    <li><h2>Gather your equipment</h2><p>You'll need a large heavy saucepan, a spatula, an instant-read thermometer, clean glass jars with lids, and cheesecloth (if you want to strain the yogurt).Sterilize your jars and lids by washing them in hot soapy water. Rinse thoroughly. Place the jars in a large pot and fill them with water to cover. Bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes, then turn off the heat. You can do this step up to 30 minutes before you are ready to fill your jars, so they stay nice and warm before you fill them with yogurt</p></li>
    <li><h2>Heat and cool milk</h2><p>Using your saucepan and instant-read thermometer, bring the milk to 180 degrees F, stirring often. (This will change the protein structure, so the milk can set into a solid.) Then, bring the temperature back down to 110 to 115 degrees F. This can take a while, but stirring the milk often will help it cool faster. To cool it even faster, you can place the saucepan of milk in an ice bath and stir it.</p></li>
    <li><h2>Add starter culture</h2><p>There are two choices for inoculating your homemade yogurt with the right cultures. The easiest is to simply grab your favorite yogurt from the fridge. To inoculate a half gallon of milk, you'll need half a cup of unflavored yogurt. Make sure that the ingredient label lists live active cultures (such as S. Thermophilus or L. Acidophilus), and not just stabilizers. You can also use a freeze-dried culture, which can be purchased online or at a health food store.
    Whisk together about 1 cup of warm milk and the yogurt. Pour this mixture back into the saucepan and stir to combine.</p></li>
    <li><h2>Let yogurt thicken</h2><p>This is where the magic happens. The trick is to keep the yogurt warm (about 110 degrees F) for an extended period of time, so the cultures can get to work and thicken the yogurt. Either ladle the (still liquid) yogurt into clean glass jars and cover with a lid, or leave the yogurt in the saucepan and cover with a lid.

    <p><strong>Counter top and oven option</strong>: Place the yogurt in a warm spot in your kitchen (wrapped in a towel, if your kitchen is breezy), in a gas oven with just the pilot light on, or in an insulated cooler surrounded by warm water. Depending on your environment temperature, culture strength, and other factors, this could take 12 to 24 hours.</p>
